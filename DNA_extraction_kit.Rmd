Modified instructions specific for extracting DNA from mouse liver samples
-------


### Part 1

#### Before beginning:
- Set heat block to 55ºC.
- Fill an ice pan with ice.

#### Instructions:

#.  Transfer ~20 mg tissue to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep sample in ice pan when 
    not in use.
#.  Add 200 µL TL Buffer.
#.  Grind sample using disposable pestle and motor.
#.  Add 25 µL OB Protease Solution. Vortex to mix thoroughly.
#.  Incubate at 55°C in the heat block, and vortex the sample every 20-30 minutes (when 
    possible). Allow samples to incubate overnight, or at least 3 hours if you're in a 
    rush.


### Part 2

#### Before beginning (allow ~1 hr):

- Set water bath to 70ºC, fill with dH<sub>2</sub>O, and allow it to reach 70ºC.
- Vortex Elution Buffer and transfer enough of it for all samples ([# samples $+$ 1]
  $\times$ 100µL) to microcentrifuge tube(s). Place in heated water bath.
- Dilute HBC Buffer with isopropanol (see bottle for instructions).
- Dilute DNA Wash Buffer with ethanol (see bottle for instructions).



#### Instructions:

*Note*: "HiBind DNA Mini Column" and "Collection Tube" are those provided in the 
*E.Z.N.A.* kit.


#.  Remove samples from heat block, vortex to mix, and briefly spin down to remove
    moisture from inside of the lid.
    
#.  Add 5 µL RNase A, and let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes.

#.  Centrifuge at maximum speed (≥10,000 $\times$ *g*) for 5 minutes at room temperature.

#.  Transfer the supernatant to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Do not disturb or
    transfer any of the insoluble pellet.

#.  Add 220 µL BL Buffer. Vortex to mix thoroughly. A wispy precipitate may form upon the
    addition of BL Buffer. This does not interfere with DNA recovery.

#.  Incubate at 70°C in water bath for 10 minutes.

#.  Add 220 µL 100% ethanol. Vortex to mix thoroughly.

#.  Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2 mL Collection Tube.

#.  Transfer the entire sample in the microcentrifuge tube to the HiBind DNA Mini Column,
    including any precipitates that may have formed.

#.  Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute. Discard the filtrate; reuse the 
    collection tube.

#.  Add 500 µL HBC Buffer.

#.  Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds. Discard the filtrate *and* collection 
    tube.

#.  Insert the HiBind DNA Mini Column into a new 2 mL Collection Tube.

#.  DNA wash:
    a. Add 700 µL DNA Wash Buffer. 
    b. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 30 seconds.
    c. Discard the filtrate; reuse the collection tube.

#.  *Run a second DNA wash.*

#.  Centrifuge the empty HiBind DNA Mini Column at maximum speed for 2 minutes to dry the
    column. This step is critical for removal of trace ethanol that may interfere with
    downstream applications.

#.  Transfer the HiBind DNA Mini Column into a nuclease-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.

#.  DNA elution:
    a. Add 50 µL Elution Buffer heated to 70°C.
    b. Let sit at room temperature for 2 minutes. 
    c. Centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 minute.

#.  *Run a second DNA elution.*

#.  Store eluted DNA at -20°C.
